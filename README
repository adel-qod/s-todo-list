This is a simple, light weight to-do list to be used from a shell interface

NAME: s-todo-list stands for SHELL TO DO LIST

It allows the insertion, completion and listing of tasks.

Tasks should have two attributes, importance and urgency.
Importance can take two values: Important or not
Urgency can take two values: urgent or not

The code is a straight-forward, scripting style code with no complex objects
The code as it currently stands needs some cleaning to make it more usable

We've got the following functions:
printOptionsList: prints the main menu of the program
clear: clears the terminal screen and returns the cursor to the up-left corner
add: adds a new task
listTasks: Lists the tasks the user has
finish: marks a task as completed and removes it from the list

then there's a section, I am marketing it with a comment as the main.
It basically clears the terminal, prints the user info and and then promts the user for input and handles it accordingly
